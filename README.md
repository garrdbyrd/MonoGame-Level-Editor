# Caspian: A MonoGame Level Editor
This is a level editor for my game made with MonoGame, project named "Pevensie". This level editor is made with Qt6.

(repo: https://github.com/garrdbyrd/MonoGame-Example)

This is made with Qt. This will not have its own dev diary, that is also in Pevensie. It can be built with cmake, edited with your favorite Qt tools.
