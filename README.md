# Caspian: A MonoGame Level Editor
This is a level editor for my game made with MonoGame, project named "Pevensie". This level editor is made with Qt6.

(repo: https://github.com/garrdbyrd/MonoGame-Example)

This is made with Qt. This will not have its own dev diary, that is also in Pevensie. It can be built with cmake, edited with your favorite Qt tools.

Disclaimer: I am extremely new to Qt and don't really know how it works.

# To-do list
